**Final Project:**
risk factors identification of adverse Venous thromboembolism (VTE) sequelae

**Project Objective:**
The primary purpose of the cohort study is to investigate the risk factors of adverse VTE sequelae. For the part of statistical inference, we test the null hypothesis that there is no association between sex and the risk of VTE recurrence or death in the year after incident VTE. To better characterize the association, further analysis is conducted on how menopausal status modify the association between sex and risk. For the part of prediction, a prognostic model is built to predict whether individuals will experience VTE recurrence or death within one year after an incident VTE.
